<div class="body"> <span class="tab">I was graduating early</span>
   and leaving the friends and connections I had made in Berkeley prematurely. My co-worker and friend
    approached me with the opportunity to develop for a wealth management startup in San Diego. Leaving the Bay had become a
    recent goal of mine, as I sought to leave my comfort zone and start anew.

I am extremely thankful for this experience</span>
    as it has begun shaping me as a young professional. Waking up early for a 6am workout, getting yelled at by Gill
    to push harder during a WOD (workout of the day) at the Crossfit gym. Showing up to work amped and ready to proceed
    with the daily onslaught of bugs and rewrites, that would incrementally prepare the database for production. Racing to the
    beach after work to hop in the water for a quick surf or just to watch the sun set over the water.</div>

<div class="body"> <span class="tab">The friends and family I have found here </span>
    have proven extremely rewarding. The CEO of Willport Trust
     took me under her wing and as I built the low-level infrastructure
    to manage her specific storage needs she brought me coffee and taught me about corporations, convertible notes, and her diverse
    set of experiences as a business woman form Texas.
